===Inputs===

===Tasks===
1. Identify and extract atomic declarative statements from the chunk given the extraction guidelines
2. Label these (1) as Fact, Opinion, or Prediction and (2) temporally as Static or Dynamic

===Extraction Guidelines===
- Structure statements to clearly show subject-predicate-object relationships
- Each statement should express a single, complete relationship (it is better to have multiple smaller statements to achieve this)
- Avoid complex or compound predicates that combine multiple relationships
- Must be understandable without requiring context of the entire document
- Should be minimally modified from the original text
- Must be understandable without requiring context of the entire document,
    - resolve co-references and pronouns to extract complete statements, if in doubt use main_entity for example:
      "your nearest competitor" -> "main_entity's nearest competitor"
    - There should be no reference to abstract entities such as 'the company', resolve to the actual entity name.
    - expand abbreviations and acronyms to their full form

- Statements are associated with a single temporal event or relationship
- Include any explicit dates, times, or quantitative qualifiers that make the fact precise
- If a statement refers to more than 1 temporal event, it should be broken into multiple statements describing the different temporalities of the event.
- If there is a static and dynamic version of a relationship described, both versions should be extracted

  TechNova Q1 Transcript (Edited Version)
  Attendees:
  * Matt Taylor
    ABC Ltd - Analyst
  * Taylor Morgan
    BigBank Senior - Coordinator
  ----
  On April 1st, 2024, John Smith was appointed CFO of TechNova Inc. He works alongside the current Senior VP Olivia Doe. He is currently overseeing the company’s global restructuring initiative, which began in May 2024 and is expected to continue into 2025.
  Analysts believe this strategy may boost profitability, though others argue it risks employee morale. One investor stated, “I think Jane has the right vision.”
  According to TechNova’s Q1 report, the company achieved a 10% increase in revenue compared to Q1 2023. It is expected that TechNova will launch its AI-driven product line in Q3 2025.
  Since June 2024, TechNova Inc has been negotiating strategic partnerships in Asia. Meanwhile, it has also been expanding its presence in Europe, starting July 2024. As of September 2025, the company is piloting a remote-first work policy across all departments.
  Competitor SkyTech announced last month they have developed a new AI chip and launched their cloud-based learning platform.
